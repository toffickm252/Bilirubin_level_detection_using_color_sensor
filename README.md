# WELCOME TO MY GITHUB REPOSITORY FOR MY FINAL YEAR PROJECT - BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING

***Problem Statement:***
In clinical phototherapy monitoring, invasive technique of determining bilirubin concentration in jaundiced neonates takes time, causes trauma to neonates,
and the procedure is also infection prone. Available bilirubinometers are also costly and other non-invasive techniques usually require internet 
access to function hence may not be readily reliable.

***General Objective***
This project focuses on building a portable device to non-invasively determine and monitor bilirubin level reduction in neonates 
with jaundice undergoing phototherapy.

***Significance of Work***

* This work is useful in healthcare facilities specifically in the NICU for enhancing jaundice diagnosing time.
* Elimination of neonatal trauma caused by repetitive venipuncture or heel pricking.
* Prevent the occurrence of infection that could arise due to repeated venipuncture or heel pricking.
* The device is cost friendly and can function without internet connection aid.
